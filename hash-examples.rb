# Hashes are sometimes referred to as objects

# Example using hash rockets
example_hash = {
  "name" => "cool object",
  "favorite_num" => 21,
  "collection_of_letters" => ['a', 'x', 'p']
}

# {} symbols denote an hash and are called curly braces.
# key-value pairs are variables that exist within a hash.
# keys are the variable names specific to the hash; MUST BE UNIQUE!
# values are associated to specific keys; can be assigned to any data type.
# => symbol is referred to as a hash rocket; not necessary if using symbol data types (:name)

# Example using symbol data types
example_hash = {
  name: "cool object",
  favorite_num: 21,
  collection_of_letters: ['a', 'x', 'p']
}

# Describe example using the following technical vocabulary:
1. variable name
2. assignment operator
3. curly braces
4. key-value pairs
5. hash rocket
6. double quotes
